My name is Jinsong Lin, and I’m currently a freshman at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering with a plan to also earn a Master’s in Computer Science. I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in New York City, where I developed a passion for technology and coding. I have foundational skills in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Linux, and SQL, and I enjoy learning more about cybersecurity. In my free time, I love playing basketball just for fun, especially at the courts in Gordon Field House on campus, which has been a highlight of my college experience so far.
